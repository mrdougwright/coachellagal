# == Class Info
#
#  Every monetary charge creates an invoice.  Thus when you charge a customer XYZ,
#  you are actually using an invoice for the charge and not the order.  This allows
#  flexibility within accounting and returns and even some new charge that will be made
#  in the future.  If the system was only doing Cash-Based account the Invoices table
#  would be the only table needed.  NOTE: DO NOT THINK FOR A SECOND CASH BASED ACCOUNT IS GOOD ENOUGH!
