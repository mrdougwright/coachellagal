    <h2><b class="uppercase">Automatic Renewal</b></h2>
    <p>With regards to any product made available to you on a monthly (or other period) subscription as sold through the Site or otherwise (including any free trial product) (the "Product"), the default term of our agreement shall be for so long as we make the Product available to you. If you have provided us with a valid credit card number or an alternate payment method, your subscription will be automatically renewed (and charged to the account you have provided) for another term at the expiration of your current term, whenever local regulations allow, for a fee no greater than our then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing.</p>
    <p>The new term will be for the same duration as the expired term unless otherwise specified at time of renewal. This renewal will be processed (and your card charged) within 30 days prior to the expiration of the term and each period thereafter. If you do not desire to have your subscription automatically renewed, you must, prior to the expiration of your subscription term, inform us of your intention not to renew your subscription to the product.</p>
    <p>You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.

You must promptly notify us if your credit card is cancelled (for example, for loss or theft). Changes to such information can be made by contacting our Customer Service department.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or discontinue the supply of the Product to any user at any time at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2><b class="uppercase">Demand for Arbitration</b></h2>
    <p>By using the <%= site_name %> website and/or placing an order for <%= site_name %> products or services, you agree that all disputes arising under this Agreement will be resolved in small claims court or by arbitration. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. <%= site_name %> is committed to resolving all disputes in a fair, effective, and cost-efficient manner. Accordingly, our Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") provide that disputes will be resolved in binding arbitration or small claims court. <%= site_name %>'s arbitration provision, which is set forth below, has been designed to make arbitration as convenient and inexpensive for our customers as possible. Among other things, it specifies that <%= site_name %> will bear all costs of arbitration (unless a customer's claims exceed $75,000 or an arbitrator determines that the claims are frivolous), and that, under certain circumstances (explained in the arbitration provision), <%= site_name %> will pay a premium if a customer receives an arbitration award greater than the value of <%= site_name %>'s settlement offer, and will pay the customer's reasonable attorney's fees. As part of <%= site_name %>'s commitment to a fair, effective, and cost-efficient resolution of all disputes, <%= site_name %> has made its current arbitration provision available to all current and former customers. <%= site_name %> will abide by the terms of its current arbitration provision in all instances. Customers whose Terms include arbitration provisions that differ from the current arbitration provision may arbitrate pursuant to the terms of either arbitration provision at their discretion. Similarly, former customers whose Terms did not include an arbitration provision may arbitrate their disputes under the current arbitration provision.</p>
    <h2><b><i>Dispute resolution by binding Arbitration</i></b></h2>
    <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
    <h2><b><i>Summary:</i></b></h2>
    <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction contacting our Client Services Department. In the unlikely event that <%= site_name %>'s Client Services Department is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if <%= site_name %> has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, <%= site_name %> will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from <%= site_name %> to the same extent or more as you would in court. Under certain circumstances (as explained below), <%= site_name %> will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorney's fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than what <%= site_name %> offered you to settle the dispute.</p>
    <h2><b><i>Arbitration Agreement:</i></b></h2>
    <p>(a) <%= site_name %> and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a single arbitrator. The types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted. It applies, without limitation, to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.</li>
      <li>Claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
      <li>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
      <li>Claims that may arise after termination of these Terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "<%= site_name %> "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and <%= site_name %> are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
    <p>(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to <%= site_name %> should be addressed to:  Notice of Dispute, Legal Department, <%= company_name %>, <%= I18n.t(:company_address1) %> <%= I18n.t(:company_address2) %> <%= I18n.t(:company_address3) %> (the "Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If <%= site_name %> and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or <%= site_name %> may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by <%= site_name %> or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or <%= site_name %> is entitled.</p>
    <p>(c) After <%= site_name %> receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $75,000. (Currently, the filing fee is $125 for claims under $10,000, but this is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, <%= site_name %> will pay it directly after receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. Unless <%= site_name %> and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your contact address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If you choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or submission. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The parties agree that any awards or findings of fact or conclusions of law made in an arbitration of their dispute or claim are made only for the purposes of that arbitration, and may not be used by any other person or entity in any later arbitration of any dispute or claim involving <%= site_name %>. The parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which <%= site_name %> was a party. Except as otherwise provided for herein, <%= site_name %> will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse <%= site_name %> for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. An award may be entered against a party who fails to appear at a duly noticed hearing.</p>
    <p>(d) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of <%= site_name %>'s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then <%= site_name %> will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and</li>
      <li>Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigation, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the "attorney's fees").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If <%= site_name %> did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
    <p>(e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs. Although under some laws <%= site_name %> may have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, <%= site_name %> will not seek such an award.</p>
    <p>(f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. You and <%= site_name %> agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacities and not as plaintiffs or class members in any purported class or representative proceeding or in the capacity of a private attorney general. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the parties agree that any injunctive award may be vacated or corrected on appeal by either party to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Each party will bear its own costs and fees on any such appeal. The arbitrator shall not award relief in excess of what these Terms provide or award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by actual damages. Further, unless both you and <%= site_name %> agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
    <p>(g) All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential, other than as part of an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
